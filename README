## Main Menu Breakdown
Upon execution, the script presents the **Main Menu** with the following options:

### 1. Setup Menu
Configure and initialize YubiKeys for secure authentication and SSH usage.

**Options:**
- **1) Install Dependencies** – Automatically installs necessary dependencies (e.g., `ykman`, `ssh`, `openssl`).
- **2) Configure YubiKey (PIN, PUK, Management Key)** – Guides users through setting up or changing PINs, PUKs, and management keys for PIV.
- **3) Configure YubiKey for SSH** – Sets up the YubiKey to generate FIDO2 SSH keys or RSA keys using the PIV interface.
- **4) Back to Main Menu** – Returns to the main menu.

---

### 2. Keys Management Menu
This menu focuses on SSH key generation, export, and YubiKey key management.

**Options:**
- **1) Generate FIDO2 SSH Key** – Creates a FIDO2 SSH key directly on the YubiKey.
- **2) Generate ssh-rsa PIV Key** – Generates an RSA SSH key using the YubiKey PIV applet.
- **3) Package PKCS12 PIV Key** – Converts private keys to the PKCS#12 format for import/export.
- **4) Import SSH Key** – Imports existing SSH keys into the YubiKey.
- **5) Export SSH Keys** – Exports public keys (FIDO2 or PIV) from the YubiKey.
- **6) List SSH Keys** – Lists all SSH keys currently stored in the YubiKey.
- **7) Remove SSH Key from YubiKey** – Deletes specific SSH keys from the YubiKey slots.
- **8) Back to Main Menu** – Returns to the main menu.

---

### 3. SSH Operations Menu
Handles SSH configurations and remote connections.

**Options:**
- **1) Manage SSH Configurations** – Opens or modifies SSH configurations, allowing users to add YubiKey SSH keys.
- **2) Start SSH Session** – Starts an SSH session using IPv6 configurations saved in the system.
- **3) Back to Main Menu** – Returns to the main menu.

---

### 4. Settings Menu
Manage disk encryption, smart cards, and backup configurations.

**Options:**
- **1) Backup Configuration** – Backs up current YubiKey configurations (e.g., management keys, SSH keys).
- **2) Restore Configuration** – Restores backed-up configurations.
- **3) Manage OSX Full Disk Encryption** – Manages FileVault and encrypts/decrypts system disks using the YubiKey.
- **4) Factory Reset YubiKey** – Fully resets the YubiKey to factory settings.
- **5) Manage Smart Cards** – Configures smart cards to pair with macOS accounts.
- **6) Back to Main Menu** – Returns to the main menu.

---

## Key Features
- **Automated Dependency Installation** – Ensures the required tools (`ykman`, `openssl`, `jq`) are installed.
- **SSH Key Management** – Create and manage SSH keys directly on YubiKey hardware.
- **FIDO2 and PIV Support** – Generate FIDO2-based keys or use PIV applets for secure RSA keys.
- **Smart Card Management** – Configure YubiKeys as macOS login smart cards.
- **Disk Encryption** – Utilize YubiKey for macOS Full Disk Encryption (FileVault).
- **Backup & Restore** – Easily back up and restore YubiKey configurations.
- **Factory Reset** – Reset YubiKeys to factory settings if necessary.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **YubiKey Manager (ykman)** – Manage YubiKey functionalities.
- **OpenSSH** – For SSH key generation and SSH agent handling.
- **jq** – JSON parser to manipulate config files.
- **openssl** – Encryption and certificate handling.
- **bash** – Script is designed for bash environments (Linux/macOS/WSL).

---

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jw-wcv/yubikey-manager.git
   cd yubikey-manager
   ```
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x key_manager.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./key_manager.sh
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage YubiKey operations.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Key Not Recognized by SSH**:
   - Ensure the public key has been added to the remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
   - Use `ssh-add -L` to verify loaded SSH keys.
- **PIN/PUK Errors**:
   - Reset PINs using the **Setup** menu if locked out.
- **SSH Connection Issues**:
   - Use `ssh -vvv user@vm-ip` to debug connection issues.
